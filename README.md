There is one lane closed of a two-lane road, with traffic coming from the North and South. Because of traffic lights, the traffic on the road comes in bursts. When a car arrives, there is an 80% chance of another car following it, but once no car comes, there is a 20 second delay (use the provided pthread_sleep here) before any new car will come.

=======
During the times when no cars are at either end, the flag person will fall asleep. When a car arrives at either end, the flag person will wake up and allow traffic from that side to pass the construction area, until there are no more cars from that side, or until there are 10 cars or more lining up on the opposite side. If there are 10 cars or more on the opposite side, the flag person needs to allow the cars from the opposite side to pass. Each car takes 1 second to go through the construction area.

Your job is to construct a simulation of these events where under no conditions will a deadlock occur. A deadlock could either be that the flag person does not allow traffic through from either side, or letâ€™s traffic through from both sides causing an accident.
